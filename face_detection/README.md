Face detection from opencv:

Usually finds faces when they are big and facing the screen.

Slightly rotated faces are usually not detected.

For min_neighbors < 20 there are a lot of false positives.

For min_neighbors > 50 some faces are not detected.

Dog is not recognized (thank god) as human's face.
