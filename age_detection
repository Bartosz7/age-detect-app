Datasets which can be used:
KANFace (almost at hand)
KANFace consists of 40K still images and 44K sequences (14.5M video frames in total) captured in unconstrained, real-world conditions from 1,045 subjects. 
The dataset is manually annotated in terms of identity, exact age, gender and kinship. To gain access to the dataset, please visit this fill in the form below.

UTKFace (available at hand)
Introduced by Zhang et al. in Age Progression/Regression by Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder
The UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. 
The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.

IMDB-WIKI â€“ 500k+ face images with age and gender labels
probably the best but maybe to much data to process
