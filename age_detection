UTKFace (available at hand)
Introduced by Zhang et al. in Age Progression/Regression by Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder
The UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. 
The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.

MORPH (need request and needs to be paid...)
MORPH is a facial age estimation dataset, which contains 55,134 facial images of 13,617 subjects ranging from 16 to 77 years old.
